# Knight Moves

This is an implementation of Ben Finegold's Knight and Queen puzzle.
You can play it [here](https://243f.github.io/knightmoves/).

Some features:

1. Compares the path you took to the ideal minimal path.
2. Can provide hints
3. Customize board: Move queen to any square, add other pieces,
change starting square.
4. It's possible to randomize the order of the squares.

Apologies for the code being quite messy. I originally meant
to write a simple solver for the puzzle, but then quickly hacked
together a working version of it.

This puzzle uses [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) and
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
